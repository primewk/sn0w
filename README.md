This client was made by MEDMEX for 2beta2t.net and has pretty much all the features a client from that era would need, its better then other clients "from that era" coz Sn0w was made like a few years ago.

FUN FACT: This is an ACTUAL hacked client and not a minecraft utility mod coz you're changing (hacking) the default minecraft client (minecraft.jar), if it were running as a mod then it would've been a minecraft utility client.
